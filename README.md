# Description of the project

The goal of this project is to discover the wonderful world of virtualization. I had to choose between 2 Linux distribution (Debian or Rocky). For this project I chose to go with Rocky.

<ins>But what are the differences ?</ins>

Both version are highly stable with regular security updates.
Rocky is optimized for entreprise workload where Debian is more suitable for various applications and needs. 
Therefore Rocky is focused for entreprises and servers where Debian is more versatile and thus better for desktop usage or in some cases for servers. This makes Rocky less customizable than Debian but focused on stability. 

# Instructions for the project

In the git you have a signature.txt with my virtual machine's virtual disk signature. You have to compare it with the one of my virtual machine. 

If you open the VM a monitoring script appears at startup and every 10 minutes. This script shows the different components of the virtual machine. 

You should see :

**The architecture of the operation system and its kernel version**

**The physical and virtual processor(s)**

**The current available RAM on the server and its utilization rate in percent**

**The current available storage and its utilization rate in percent**

**The current utilization rate of the processor(s) in percent**

**The date and time of the last reboot**

**Whether LVM is active or not**

**The number of active TCP connections**

**The number of users using the server**

**The ipv4 adress of the server and its MAC (Media Access Control) adress**

**The number of sudo commands executed**
